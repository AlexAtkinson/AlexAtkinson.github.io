                <h1>DevOps & Beyond</h1>
                <p class="small">
                    I'm an original Dev*Ops. I've enjoyed watching DevOps evolve, splitting into DevSecOps, SRE, Platform Engineering, Developer Experience, and even Digital Transformation, but at the end of the day it comes down to a single objective: <i>the optimization of the SDLC and ALM to maximize value stream potential</i>.<br>
                    It sounds simple, and it <i>may be</i>, but the odds of that are slim. This is where I come in.
                </p>
                <p class="small">
                    Having had the fortune of working with some amazing people and organizations, from startups to global enterprises across a variety of industries, I've built a broad suite of expertise that spans the various disciplines involved in the SDLC and ALM. One of the major benefits of this is being able to size solutions for organizations appropriately for their products, market, region, and objectives. This is essential in enabling corporate agility, and getting things moving in the right direction early, while avoiding technical debt.
                </p>
                <p class="small">
                    I am very specifically <i>not</i> a developer, and will never advertise myself as such. My expertise lies in: Infrastructure, Platform Engineering, DevOps, and Quality of Life. That said, aside from the usual operational tooling, I have been known to write some wicked code, on occasion. This website, for example, achieves a perfect <a href="https://web.dev/measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:var(--accent)">100/100 performance score</a>, and is built entirely from scratch, with no frameworks or libraries.
                </p>

                <h2>My Priorities</h2>
                <p class="small">
                    Simply put: Quality of Life -- everything else comes naturally if this is your north star.
                </p>
                <p class="small">
                    Simple to say, and difficult to achieve, but keep the following in mind:
                </p>
                <ul class="small">
                    <li>The happy employee produces better product, and more meaningfully participates in the organization.</li>
                    <li>Healthier organizations have happier customers.</li>
                    <li>Happy customers result in higher NPS.</li>
                    <li>Measure both NPS and eNPS regularly -- they are intrinsically linked.</li>
                    <li>Do 360 reviews. It doesn't take much for an organization to slide.</li>
                    <li>Have a culture of continuous improvement.</li>
                    <li>Practice <i><a href="https://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/insightshub/leadership-career-development/lead-bigger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:var(--accent)">servant leadership</a></i> -- even if you're not <i>yet</i> leadership.</li>
                    <li>Be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:var(--accent)">The Toyota Way (LEAN)</a>, <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:var(--accent)">SAFe/Agile</a>, and other relevant methodologies, but understand that none of it is doctrine.</li>
                    <li>Know the <a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:var(--accent)">12-factors</a>.</li>
                    <li>Don't over-value metrics. Be wary of their misuse and always consider the context.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="small">
                    These are just a few, high-level, leadership-targeted points.<br>
                    Above all, remember that people are your greatest asset. Technology is just a tool to help us all achieve more, and ultimately improve our circumstances in life.
                </p>
